scikit-xray-examples
--------------------
Repository for demonstrating/tutorializing scientific capabilities of 
scikit-xray.  This is a separate repository from scikit-xray because we are 
hosting scientific data next to the example scripts and, as no one likes a huge 
library, it seems sensible to separate these scientific datasets.

will update to include 1-time correlation once it is merged
